        <img src="images.jpeg">

    <h2>Description</h2> 
        <p>Perfectly crisp-tender saut√©ed broccolini is a quick and easy side dish that pairs well with any protein </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 buches broccolini, stem ends trimmed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, sliced</li>
        <li>1 dl water, or as needed</li>
        <li>1/2 lemon</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Cooking Steps</h4>
    <ol>
    <li>Rinse broccolini and pat dry.</li>
    <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute broccolini for 3 to 4 minutes, turning occasionally, until broccolini begins turning a bright green color and edges are starting to brown. Add garlic slices and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Pour in water, cover with a lid and reduce heat to medium-low. Steam broccolini until crisp-tender and water has evaporated, 3 to 4 more minutes. If you prefer more tender broccolini, add in a bit more water, cover, and cook for a few more minutes</li>
    <li>Squeeze lemon over broccolini and season with salt to taste.</li>
    </ol>
